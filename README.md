# Inferno Collection: Whitelist
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/inferno-collection/Whitelist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/inferno-collection/Whitelist)

__Public Beta Version 1.2 Beta__

The Inferno Whitelist is specifically designed for server owners looking for a way to allow other people (such as Admins, Mods, etc.) to add and remove people for their server whitelist, without needing to give them Box/FTP/Control Panel access. Inferno Whitelist, though the use of PasteBin and it's free API, provide server owners a way of doing this. In a nutshell, server owners create a PasteBin whitelist, allow other people to edit said whitelist, then the Inferno Whitelist resource automatically collects the whitelist every X minutes, where X is configurable.

**Some assembly is required, make sure to read the [installation guide](https://github.com/inferno-collection/Whitelist/wiki/Installation-Guide)!**

Presently, the following can be customized:
- How often the whitelist automatically refreshes.
